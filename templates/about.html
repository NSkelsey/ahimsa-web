<h4>The Big Picture</h4>
<p>
ahimsa enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish uncensorable statements within Bitcoin's block chain.
These statements, referred to as bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a
smartphone or a computer.  These statements can be viewed from any computer that can connect to the Bitcoin network.
</p>
<p>
Once a bulletin is included within the longset honest chain it is effectively immutable. This prinicple lies
at the core of ahimsa. If a user can get a bulletin into the block chain it as permanent as any Bitcoin
transaction. If that transaction remains unspent then it must be stored in perpetuity by the entire network. 
Any software that understands our messaging protocol and has a copy of the blockchain can then decode these 
bulletins and display them.
</p> 
<p>
An attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire honest network 
to prevent a user from publishing bulletins. This means that many smaller states do not have the infrastructure to 
censor public statements created through our application. In essence, we have created a tool for the politically minded
that demand the freedom of the press where there is none.

    <h3>FAQs<small>Because we know this is confusing.</small></h3>
</div>
<h4>What are you trying to do again?</h4>
<p>We are implementing a censorship resistant messaging system. We want public statements and public information to remain public for as long as possible. Bitcoin is an excellent platform to achieve this goal.</p>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Bitcoin has been trumpted as a tool for finacial freedom. We want to use it to empower the fourth estate.</p>
<h4>Isn't it expensive and rude to store data in the blockchain?</h4>
<p>Yes and yes. All told it will be about 12 cents to store a single tweet in the blockchain. But there are a couple methods to reduce that cost further.</p>
<h4>Half of your website is totally broken. What am I even looking at?</h4>
<p>We are aware of how broken it all is and we are working on it. Have an ice pop</p>
<h4>My country blocked Twitter, won't they also block ahimsa?</h4>
<p>Great question. Your country could definitely block ahimsa.io since it is a static domain, but anybody could host the content displayed on this site. All you need is a bitcoin server and a copy of our software, which is free and open source.</p>
<h4>Ok, that's well and dandy, but aren't you just relying on Bitcoin getting around a governmets ban?</h4>
<p>In short, yes. Bitcoin is a much harder system to take down then your typical website. In addition, the blockchain <a href="">guarantees</a> the immutability of bulletins stored within it. This means that any computer with access to Bitcoin has access to every bulletin created using ahimsa.</p>
